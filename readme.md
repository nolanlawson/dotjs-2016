This is a talk about Service Worker and how they "appify" the web.

# Service Workers

- They're hot &#x0001f525;
- They "move the web forward"

Now, if you're like me, you've probably heard a lot about Service Workers. How they're going to "revolutionize" the
web platform. How you should "look busy" because they're coming. How they change everything.

So Service Workers are hot, and they "move the web forward." But what exactly does that mean? Well, to understand
what "move the web forward" means, you need to take a look at where the web has been.
